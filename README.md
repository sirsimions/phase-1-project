## Description
## Description
This app provides a solution to most challenges faced by classroom teachers. Traditionally, institutions rely on Excel to perform statistical analysis. While Excel tends to be robust, its efficiency relies on one's knowledge of functions. The current app therefore, addresses this challenge by provoding an app that fetches data from a database and calculates crucial measures of central tendency and dispersion including mean, median, standard deviation, and range by simply clicking appropriate buttons. Moreover, once the page loades, it automatically fetches all the students' details and displays them on the web. Individual student details can be viewed by clicking the name. The app also does a comparison internally and determines the overal grade of the class, and also outputs highest and lowest scores. 
## Setup and Installation Requirements
* The requirements for hosting of this app include domain name, hosting provider, and hosting plan. 
* There are no additional codes required. No dependencies are required for this app to run. However, the app needs a     database and servers because the app fetches data for analysis. 
* The database can be set internally (as a json file) or fetched from a url (public database). The most important issue is to ensure that the keys match so that right values are fetched. 
## Known Bugs
There are currently no issues that affect the functionality of the app. The stability of the wep app may, however, be influenced by the strength of network. It is recommended that one must have stable internet for efficient use. 
## Technologies Used
The app was developed using three technologies namely HTML v. 5, JavaScript, and CSS. HTML was used to create the web page and styling was done using CSS. JavaScript was mainly used to provide the interactivity.
