## Description
This app provides a solution to most challenges faced by tourist and other people interested in travelling to different places of the world. Currently, people have to conduct multiple searches to obtain information of a particular country's  Covid 19 status. The current app therefore, addresses this challenge by provoding an app that fetches data from a public database and display crucial statistics such as number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and country's geolocation. One only needs to click the country of interest to view all the information. 
## Setup and Installation Requirements
* The requirements for hosting of this app include domain name, hosting provider, and hosting plan. 
* There are no additional codes required. No dependencies are required for this app to run. However, the app needs a     database and servers because the app fetches data for analysis. 
* The database can be set internally (as a json file) or fetched from a url (public database). The most important issue is to ensure that the keys match so that right values are fetched.
