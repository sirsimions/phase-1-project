## Description
This app provides a solution to most challenges faced by classroom teachers. Traditionally, institutions rely on Excel to perform statistical analysis. While Excel tends to be robust, its efficiency relies on one's knowledge of functions. The current app therefore, addresses this challenge by provoding an app that fetches data from a database and calculates crucial measures of central tendency and dispersion including mean, median, standard deviation, and range by simply clicking appropriate buttons. Moreover, once the page loades, it automatically fetches all the students' names and displays them on the web. The app also does a comparison internally and determines the overal grade of the class, and also outputs highest and lowest scores.
